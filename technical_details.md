## Technical Details 

### Back-End
The application will be hosted on a realtime database by Firebase called [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), which will be used to store data from the application on Firebase's cloud. This will include chat exchanges, user information and calendar events. For user account authentication we will be using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), with the [Google Sign-In](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) plugin for Flutter. This will allow users to sign in to the application using their existing google accounts. The application will integrate the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) to create the functionality of the app's calendar system. 

### Front-End
As our application will be Android based, we will be using Android Studio and XML to create our layout and UI. We will also implement the [Flutter](https://pub.dev/) Framework for a collection of easily usable UI elements. The Flutter Framework will also be used to create the UI for the [chat](https://pub.dev/packages/dash_chat), the [user profile](https://pub.dev/packages/circular_profile_avatar) and the [calendar](https://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar) elements of the application.

### Developing Tools
The application will be created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit to create mobile, web or desktop applications compatibility across all major platforms like Android & iOS. Application will be coded in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) language for Flutter applications - in [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio). [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) may also be used to test HTTP requests. 

### Supporting Tools
- Sketch.app will be used to design several vector mockups of the application.
